## Definition
* **Degree**: For undirected network, the degree of a node is given by the number of links attached to it. The degree of a node $i$ is denoted as $k_i$:$$k_i=\sum_{j=1}^nA_{ij}$$
* **Mean degree**: For undirected network $$mean\_degree=\frac{\sum{D_{degree}}}{N_{node}}$$
* **In/out-degree**: For directed network 出度和入度
* Undirected simple network: 无向图 Mathematiacal definition: Matrix
