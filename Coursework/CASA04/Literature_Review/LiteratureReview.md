# Reinforcement Learning and ABM for Traffic Signal Control: A Literature Review

## 1. Introduction:

(Provide a brief overview of reinforcement learning, agent based model and their relevance to traffic signal control.)

Traffic congestion is one of the most common and vexing issues in modern cities. It not only results in sighnificant time wastage but also increases carbon emissions, thereby negatively impacting the environment, which conflicts with UN Sustainable Development Goals([Goal 11](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cities/)).

Control of traffic signals in the existing traffic network can effectively reduce traffic congestion and even reduce fuel consumption and financial expenditures. In the government economy, ***Srinivasa Sunkari mentions*** a example on San Jose Boulevard in Jacksonville, FL, which reduced average arterial delay by 35%, resulting in estimated annual fuel savings of 65,000 gallons and overall annunal cost savings of $2.5 million(2001).  Another example in Burlington, Canada, which remanaged the signal pattern in 62 intersections, observed 7% savings in travvel time, 6% savings in fuel consumption. And this project demonstrated an annual savings of $1.06 million for delays and fuel consumption alone(2001). 

There are many way to optimize the pattern of the traffic signal to achive the 11th UN Sustainable Development Goal and many researchers have made their contribution in this area. 

These researches mainly have three parts. The first part is simulating the urban traffic system by using some methods, the second part is using different methods to investigate the best proper pattern of the traffic signal and the third part of is how to evaluate these methods and how extend it can intergrated to the current traffic system. For example, Wei, Hua and his partners using SUMO([Simulation of Urban MObility](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/)), which is a open source lib developmed by German, to simulate the urban road network and using reforcement learning to train a model to optimize the signal pattern. They used the real time statistic data from camera to train their model, which can make a higher correlation between their work and reality.make their work more reality. They also using the memory palace and the phase gate in their reforcement learning algorithm to enhance the long term memory ablilty and sensitivity of their model.

Traditional traffic signal control methods often adopt fixed-time intervals, which tend to be ineffective in the face of complex and ever-changing urban traffic flows. With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, new tools have emerged to tackle traffic congestion, among which Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows immense potential. Reinforcement Learning is a method of machine learning that enables an agent to learn how to take actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. By employing RL algorithms, we can empower traffic signal control systems to self-learn how to make optimal decisions under various traffic situations, with the goal to minimize traffic congestion and enhance road traffic efficiency to the greatest extent.
