# Part 1: London’s underground resilience:
## I. Topological network:
In this section, the data of the London tube network in graphml format provided in the Practical of week 7 will be used.  The network model can be generated by using the data, only the topological relationships between nodes are considered, and the network is named as **_G_**.

### 1.1 Centrality measures:
Centrality measures of a network are used to measure the importance of nodes in the network in different aspects. These important aspects can include the influence of nodes in terms of information dissemination, control, influence, and connectivity. In this section, three measures will be used: Degree centrality, Closeness centrality and Betweenness centrality.    

_**Degree Centrality**_ (DC) is a commonly used centrality metric to measure the importance or centrality of nodes in a network. In London tube networks, degree centrality can be used to assess the interactivity of stations, i.e., the number of direct connections to other stations. DC measures the number of direct connections of a node in the network, i.e., the degree of the node. A higher degree of a node indicates more direct connections to other nodes and thus plays a more important role in the network.    
For a node $i$ in an undirected network, degree centrality can be calculated by the following equation:
$$C_{d}(i) = \frac{k_i}{N-1} $$
where $C_d(i)$ means the degree centrality of node $i$, $k_i$ denotes the number of degrees of node $i$ (i.e., the number of edges directly connected to node $i$), and $N$ means the total number of nodes in the network. 
Based on the network G, the DC ranking of each station in the London tube network can be calculated, and the top 10 of them are shown in the following table:
|No.|station_name|degree_centrality|
|--|--|--|
|1|King's Cross St. Pancras|0.016018|
|2|Baker Street|0.016018|
|3|Oxford Circus|0.013730|

|8|Turnham Green|0.011442|
|9|Canning Town (DLR)|0.011442|
|10|Liverpool Street|0.011442|


**_Closeness Centrality_** (CC) is a metric used to measure the closeness between nodes and other nodes in a network. Closeness centrality measures the average shortest path length from a node to other nodes, i.e., the average distance between a node and other nodes. A higher proximity centrality of a node indicates that the distance between the node and other nodes is shorter and the connection is tighter.  In the London tube network, Closeness centrality indicates the average shortest path of a station to other stations, and the higher the value, the shorter the journey to the rest of the stations in the network and the more important the station is.
For a node $i$ in an undirected network, closeness centrality can be calculated by the following equation:
$$C_{c}(i) = \frac{N-1}{ {\textstyle \sum_{j=1}^{N}} d(i,j)} $$  
where $C_c(i)$ means the closeness centrality of node i, $d(i,j)$ means the shortest path length from node $i$ to node $j$, and $N$ means the total number of nodes in the network.  
Based on the network G, the CC ranking of each station in the London tube network can be calculated, and the top 10 of them are shown in the following table:
|No.|station_name|closeness_centrality|
|--|--|--|
|1|Green Park|0.094897|
|2|Bond Street|0.093737|
|3|Westminster|0.093197|
|4|Baker Street|0.092900|
|5|Waterloo|0.092389|
|6|Bank|0.092000|
|7|Oxford Circus|0.091614|
|8|Liverpool Street|0.090010|
|9|Regent's Park|0.089275|
|10|Finchley Road|0.089165|

_**Betweenness Centrality**_ (BC) is used to measure the extent to which a node acts as a mediator in the network, i.e., how often a node is on the shortest path between connecting other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality usually have strong information transfer and control capabilities in the network. The higher the betweenness centrality of a node, the more frequently the node acts as an intermediary in the network and plays an important role in the connectivity and information transfer of the network. In the London tube network, the value of betweenness centrality indicates the importance of the station as a transit station, and the higher the value, the more important the station is as a transit point. 
For a node $i$ in an undirected network, betweenness centrality can be calculated by the following equation: 
$$C_B(v) = \sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}$$
where $C_B(v)$ means the betweenness centrality of node $i$. $V$ is the set of nodes. $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of shortest $(s, t)$-paths, and $\sigma(s, t|v)$ is the number of those paths passing through some node $v$ other than $s,t$. if $s=t, \sigma(s, t)=1$ and if $v \in {s, t}, \sigma(s, t|v) = 0$.   
Based on the network G, the BC ranking of each station in the London tube network can be calculated, and the top 10 of them are shown in the following table:
|No.|station_name|betweenness_centrality|
|--|--|--|
|1|Baker Street|0.381015|
|2|Bethnal Green|0.353433|

### 1.2 Impact measures:

In order to measure the impact of station closure on the whole London tube network, this section will use two coefficients to evaluate the overall characteristics of the network. These two coefficients are: **_Average Clustering Coefficient_** and **_Degree Assortativity Coefficient_**.

**_Average clustering coefficient_** (ACC) reflects the average of the clustering coefficients of all nodes in the network. The clustering coefficient is a measure of how tightly connected a node is to its neighbors, and it measures the connectivity between a node's neighbors. For the London tube network, the neighbors of a station are the other stations adjacent to it, so the clustering coefficient reflects the degree of connectivity between stations in the subway network. The higher the average clustering coefficient, the tighter the connectivity between stations in the tube network.  

**_Degree assortativity coefficient_** (DAC) directly reflects the correlation between the degrees of nodes in the network, and indirectly reflects the structural characteristics of the network. For the London tube networks, if there is positive degree assortativity in the network, then neighboring stations are usually connected with similar number of other stations, forming a tightly connected community structure. On the contrary, if there is negative degree assortativity in the tube network, then adjacent stations are usually connected to other stations with widely varying numbers, forming a more dispersed structure.

By removing the nodes and recalculating the two coefficients, the network's resilience can be evaluated by the change of the two coefficients. If it remains unchanged or increases, it means that the network is more resilient, which means that the network is able to retain the original characteristics as much as possible. If the coefficients decreases, then it means that the network is not resilient in the corresponding metric, or the node has a greater impact on a network.   

These two measures can reflect the characteristics of the shape and clustering of the arbitrary network, which are not specific to the London tube network. For whether using these two metrics to evaluate the resilience of an arbitrary network will be significant, we need to consider factors such as the network's own characteristics. For example, if we are more concerned with the change in resilience of a network in terms of the degree of aggregation, then for an arbitrary network we would be more inclined to focus on the change in the average aggregation coefficient of that network as the nodes change.

### 1.3 Node removal:
Two strategies based on three central measure rankings, using sequential and non-sequential deletion of nodes, generated two results affecting the variation of the coefficients, as shown in the following figure:    
![[output1_3.png]]
从结果图中可以看出，DC能够更好的反映出车站对于地下运行的重要性。因为在ACC和DAC两种测量尺度下，随着节点的删除，DC的变化情况是最显著的下降趋势。在现实生活中，这意味着一个车站如果能够到达更多的其他车站，那么这个车站对于运输起到的作用越大，车站重要性也越强。但是，由于该方法只考虑了拓扑网络，所以使用这种方法去计算真实车站的重要程度，还具有一定的限制。
从结果图中可以看出，Non-sequential 删除策略对于研究网络的resilience更加有效。因为相较于Sequential 删除策略，Non-sequential 删除策略使得ACC和DAC两种指标系数下降的更快，更容易帮助我们得知关闭某个车站后对整个地铁网络结构特征的破坏程度的大小，进而更好的帮助我们研究网络的resilience。 
对于哪种影响度量能更好地评估节点移除后的损害，我认为ACC相比于DAC能更好的评估节点移除后的网络损伤。尽管在结果图中，相较于ACC，DAC受节点移除的数值下降更显著。但DAC的取值范围是从-1到1。当DAC为正时，表示网络中度值高的节点更倾向于连接到其他度值高的节点，网络具有正相关性。当DAC为负时，表示网络中度值高的节点更倾向于连接到度值低的节点，网络具有负相关性，因此DAC的值在$[-1,-0.5)\cup (0.5,1]$内才会具有较强的实际意义。从结果图中可以看出，DAC作为影响度量其值在$(-0.5,0.25)$内，即网络中节点的度值与其他节点的度值没有明显的相关性，不能准确判断网络的状态。而ACC直接反映了网络的连接紧密程度，因此我认为ACC能更好的评估节点移除后的网络损伤。
